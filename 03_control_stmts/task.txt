# Tuition Discount Calculation

# Create a Python program to calculate the tuition fee discount 
for students based on their grade levels and academic performance.


Get user input for the following information:
    Student's name 
    Student's grade level (1-12) 
    Base tuition fee 
    Discount percentage
    Academic Topper status (e.g whether the student is an academic topper or not)

Determine the discount based on the following rules:
    For students in grades 9 to 12:
    If they are academic toppers, apply a 20% discount.
    Otherwise, apply a 10% discount.
    For students in grades 6 to 8, apply a 5% discount.
    For grades below 6, apply no discount.

Additional Discounts:
    For grade 10, add an additional 3% discount.
    For grade 12, add an additional 5% discount.
    No additional discounts for other grades.

Calculate the final tuition fee after applying the discount:
    Calculate discount amount
    Calculate final fee

Output following
    Student name
    Grade level
    Academic topper status (Yes/No)
    Base tuition fee
    Total discount percentage
    Discount amount saved
    Final tuition fee after discount
