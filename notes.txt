    -> Softwares

        -> System Software

            -> Win / Linux / Unix(MACOS)

                -> Install Python 3.13.X (Python Interpreter)

                    -> Making our System Capable of running Python Code
                
                -> Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment) (Visual Studio Code)

                    -> For Writing Code

                    -> We have support For

                        -> Auto Code Completion

                        -> Syntax Highlighting

                        -> External Extensions Support

                        -> Debugging, Build Related Tools 

                -> Install Git (Version Control System - Code Tracking)

                    -> Client Software 

                    -> Track Source Code in your Workstation (Your Laptop)

                    -> Tracked Code will be uploaded to GitHub

        -> We need to setup GitHub Accounts

            -> Integrate GitHub Account with Git & IDE

20th Aug
========

-> How To Setup 

    -> Python
    -> IDE - VS Code
    -> Git (Git bash)
    -> GitHub
    -> Version Controlling
    -> Repository 
    -> Cloning 
    -> Pushing

21st Aug
========

-> Write Python Code 

    -> Script Mode (100%)

        -> Using code editor 

    -> Command Line / Interactive Mode (Quick Checks) 

        -> Directly executing code on python Interpreter using 
            CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> Syntax - Rules and guidelines 

    -> print(hello world) -- issue
    -> print(9) -- No issue

    -> 9 is literal number, it doesn't need to be defined before hand
    -> hello world is a text, which needs to be represented in single
    or double quotes

        -> print(hello world) Wrong Syntax
        -> print('hello world') Correct Syntax
    
    -> Like English has 26 alphabets, which is basis for forming 
        words and sentences
    
    -> Python has same concept, which are called as Keywords

        -> keywords + syntax = program / app

    -> import is a keyword --> imports module --> module is a .py file

22nd Aug
========

-> Identifiers 

    -> Within python an Identifier is name used to identify following

        -> variables
        -> functions
        -> classes
        -> objects
        -> methods
        -> modules 
        -> etc
    
    -> Rules for naming Identifiers

        -> Can contain

            -> letters (a-z, A-Z)
            -> digits (0-9)
            -> underscore (_) 
        
        -> Must Start With

            -> A letter (a-z, A-Z)
            -> underscore (_) 
        
        -> NOTE : Cannot start with digits 
        -> NOTE : Cannot be keywords 
        -> NOTE: Case Sensitive (Name, name, NAME) (A, a)
        -> NOTE: Always name the Identifiers appropriately
